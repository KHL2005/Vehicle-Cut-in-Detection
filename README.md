# Vehicle-Cut-in-Detection

The Vehicle Cut-In Detection Project aims to enhance road safety by identifying vehicles that cut into a lane, posing potential collision risks. This involves selecting and annotating an appropriate dataset, utilizing a pretrained deep learning model to detect and classify vehicles, and drawing bounding boxes around the detected vehicles. The project also includes estimating the speed of these vehicles, calculating the distance between them and the subject vehicle, and determining the Time to Collision (TTC) using a specific formula. If the TTC exceeds a predefined threshold, a collision warning is issued, providing timely alerts to drivers about potential hazards.
